##  Basic setup
##

# It will try these in turn and use the last one that's valid
gifdir: ./videos/static/	# for testing
gifdir: /boot/videos/static/	# for release

# Default eye colour (when not using GIF's own colours)
eyecolour: #ff8000

# Cooldown time in seconds between repeating the same (non-idle) expression
cooldown: 5

# Gapless playback is needed for static expression switching or it'll glitch
seamless: true

# The Receiver board can flash a light to acknowledge an expression
# was selected by the user.  On Xerian's hardware the LED is on pin 40
ack_pin: 40
ack_time: 600

##  Must have at least the following lines to set the default video:
#   idle: myvideo
#   gif: somevideo.gif

# Do not use pin 29 for GPIO animations.
# Pin 29 is bridged on the transmitter and will trigger continually

# Default expression
