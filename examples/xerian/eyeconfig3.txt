##  Basic setup
##

# It will try these in turn and use the last one that's valid
gifdir: ./videos/xerian/	# for testing
gifdir: /boot/videos/xerian/	# for release

# Default eye colour (when not using GIF's own colours)
eyecolour: #ff8000

# Cooldown time in seconds between repeating the same (non-idle) expression
cooldown: 5

# Percentage chance of picking a random blink animation to space things out
# Default is 75 percent
random_chance: 75

# Rainbow effect (where used)
rainbowspeed: 20
effect: rainbow_h

# The Receiver board can flash a light to acknowledge an expression
# was selected by the user.  On Xerian's hardware the LED is on pin 40
ack_pin: 40
ack_time: 600

##
##  Video list
##
##  Must have at least the following lines to set the default video:
#   idle: myvideo
#   gif: somevideo.gif
##

# Do not use pin 29 for GPIO animations.
# Pin 29 is bridged on the transmitter and will trigger continually

# Default expression
