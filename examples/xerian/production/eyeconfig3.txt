##  Basic setup
##

# It will try these in turn and use the last one that's valid
gifdir: ./videos/xerian/	# for testing
gifdir: /boot/videos/xerian/	# for release

# Use monochrome LED panels
display: MAX7219

# Enable lighting array
lights: WS2811 8
lightbrightness: 75
lightcolour: #ff8000
lightpatten: triangle

# Enable light modulation by microphone on T31
mic_pin: T31
miccolour: #ff8000
micbright: 100
micdim: 5
micinvert: true

# Turn pins 5 and 7 into virtual grounds for signalling
ground: 5
ground: 7

# The board can flash a light to acknowledge an expression was selected by the user.
# On Xerian's hardware the LED is on pin 32.  Force it to be Transmitter for single-board system.
ack_pin: T32
ack_time: 600

# Default eye colour - will be ignored for the monochrome panels anyway
eyecolour: #ff8000

# Cooldown time in seconds between repeating the same (non-idle) expression
cooldown: 5

# Percentage chance of picking a random blink animation to space things out
# Default is 75 percent
random_chance: 75

##  Video list
##
##  Must have at least the following lines to set the default video:
#   idle: myvideo
#   gif: somevideo.gif
##

# Do not use pin 29 for GPIO animations.
# Pin 29 is bridged on the transmitter and will trigger continually

# Default expression

# Random blink

	blink: default
	background: idle
	chance: 50
	ack: off

# These expressions are triggered by the GPIO pins
